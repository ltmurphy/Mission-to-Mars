## Election-Audit Summary
___
### There is a statement to the election commission that explores how this script can be used for any election, with two examples for modifying the script. This analysis can be modified to work with other elections. With small modifications it can be adapted for any region or level. The percentage levels can be focused in at higher or lower levels as well. The candidate percentage could be defined on a smaller, more accurate level leading to better predictions of future outcomes. Another potential modification would be to take advantage of demographic information such as age, sex, or even household income. This would require more data for the necessary adaptations but could provide beneficial insight.
